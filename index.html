<p>Isn't it nice?</p>

  This is a lot of text which means it spans multiple lines. When text 
  pans multiple lines like this, it's much easier to read our code if 
  we indent the multiple lines of text within our paragraph tags. 
  In other words, we add a p tag, have a line break and indent, 
  and then add our text.
